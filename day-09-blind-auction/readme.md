## Blind Auction
A command-line blind auction program

### What does it do?
The program will ask the user (i.e. bidder):
* Their name
* Their bidding price
* If there are any other bidders present [yes/no]
* If 'yes', the screen is cleared and ask for the other bidder's name & bid
* If 'no', the program determines who has the highest bid and declares it as the winner

### How does it work?
On the command-line (or terminal), type the following:<br>
python3 <b>blind_auction.py</b>

<b>NOTE:</b> It is assumed that the <b>Python 3 interpreter</b> has already been installed on your computer.

### Program Recipe:
The program is created using <b>for-in</b> & <b>while</b> loops, <b>data type conversion</b>, <b>dictionary</b> data structure, <b>if-else</b> statement and function
