## Flash Card
* A GUI-based Flash card app to help learn the French language

### What does it do?
The Flash card app will:
* Show the user a random French word on a card that is taken from a deck of cards
* Ask the user to press either the Cross button (Red) or Check button (Green)
* The Red button meant that the user doesn't know the equivalent English word
* Clicking the Red button will place the card back into the deck
* The Green button meant that the user knows the equivalent English word
* Clicking the Green button will remove the card from the deck

### How does it work?
On the command-line (or terminal), type the following:<br>
* python3 <b>flash_card.py</b>

<b>NOTE:</b> It is assumed that the <b>Python 3 interpreter</b> & <b>Pandas</b> library have already been installed and imported, respectively on your computer.
