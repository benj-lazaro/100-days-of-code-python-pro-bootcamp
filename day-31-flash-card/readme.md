## Flash Card
* A GUI-based Flash card app to help learn the French language

### What does it do?
The Flash card app will:
* Pick and display a random French word from the imported CSV file as a dictionary
* Waits for 3 seconds before the card is flipped and displays the equivalent English translation
* Clicking the Red button will place the French word back into the dictionary
* Clicking the Green button will remove the card from the dictionary

### How does it work?
On the command-line (or terminal), type the following:<br>
* python3 <b>flash_card.py</b>

<b>NOTE:</b> It is assumed that the <b>Python 3 interpreter</b> & <b>Pandas</b> library have already been installed and imported, respectively on your computer.
