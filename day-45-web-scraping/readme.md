## Top 100 Movies
* A simple web scraping web application

### What does it do?
The Top 100 Movies app will:
* Scrape information from a web archived version of Empire's Top 100 Movies (https://web.archive.org/web/20200518073855/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/)
* Retrieve all movie titles
* Re-sort the movie titles from top 1 to 100 instead of its initial order
* Write the sorted list of titles into a text file (movies.txt)

### How does it work?
On the command-line (or terminal), type the following:<br>
* python3 <b>top_100_movies.py</b>

<b>NOTE:</b> It is assumed that the <b>Python 3 interpreter</b> had already been installed on your computer.
