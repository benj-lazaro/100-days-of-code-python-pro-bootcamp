## Musical Time Machine
* A web app that lists Billboard's Top 100 song charts at a specified time period

### What does it do?
The Musical Time Machine app will:
* Ask for the date that the user would like to travel to in the format YYYY-MM-DD
* Access Billboard's Top 100 for that selected time period using the URL https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/YYYY-MM-DD
* Use BeautifulSoup to scrape the web page for the Top 100 song titles & save it on a list

### How does it work?
On the command-line (or terminal), type the following:<br>
* python3 <b>musical_time_machine.py</b>

<b>NOTE:</b> It is assumed that the <b>Python 3 interpreter</b> had already been installed on your computer.
